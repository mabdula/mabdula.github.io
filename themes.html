    <p><b> Project themes for prospective students:</b></p>
    <p style="width: 1000px;">
        If you are interested in doing a project with me (PhD, master's, bachelor's, guided research), take a look into the following general themes, or take a look into the chair for logic and verification <a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/students/"> website</a>. This should give an idea of what I find interesting.
        <ul style="width: 1000px;">
          <li>
            <b>Verifying and/or developing logic-based AI algorithms</b>: you could verify existing algorithms for classical planning or planning under uncertainty. Also, you could work on new ideas which improve the state-of-the-art of SAT-based AI planning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Verifying optimisation or graph algorithms</b>: this includes both algorithms which need substantial (graph) theory to verify, and those needing efficient implementations and data structures. E.g. matching theory, randomised approximation algorithms, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Formalising classical results in theoretical computer science</b>: e.g. results from complexity theory.
          </li>
          <!-- <li> -->
          <!--   <b>Formalising semantics of languages for describing AI planning problems</b>: together with Peter Lammich, we formalised the semantics of the classical fragment of <a href="http://www21.in.tum.de/students/"> PDDL</a> in Isabelle/HOL. Possible project ideas: formalising more of PDDL (e.g. temporal planning), developing verified tools which reason about PDDL models (e.g. model/plan validators, or using Isabelle to prove properties of PDDL models), or using existing planning technology to reason about concurrent systems in Isabelle. -->
          <!-- </li> -->
          <li>
            <b>Applications of Green's theorem or formalising Stokes' theorem</b>: currently, we have in Isabelle a fairly general statement of Green's theorem (i.e. Stokes' theorem on the plane). Project ideas include: interesting (algorithmic) applications of Green's theorem, e.g. handling boundary conditions for interesting PDE's, or formalising theory needed to realise Stokes' theorem, e.g. formalising differential forms and exterior derivatives.
          </li>
        </ul>
